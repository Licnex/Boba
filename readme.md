## Boba Biography Page

### A simple HTML [website](https://licnex.github.io/boba) that shows a biography of what I want to be in grade 10 (I'm in grade 9).

I made this because these are expectations I want to fulfill. This is not farfetched but some helpful feedback for when I do get into 10th grade. 

* Have I become what I wanted to become, or have I gotten distracted?

With these questions populating my mind, I think I'll become successful. Wish me luck!
